# Snake
This is my snake game. In order to run it you need to run the snake folder in any
IDE where java functions. Make sure to run the snake game class, as that is 
the class which containts the main method. I used intelij, but I do not see why 
any other IDEs would have issues.

Also, I would like to say I am more proud of my Chess game on my git the my
Snake game. I was just I was unable to finish the Chess project by the due date to apply,
so I had to put it on hold to make this smaller snake project. I hope you take the time to look 
at my chess project, but also be aware it is only around 50%-60% done. Parts of it will be changed and
A lot of things need to be implemented. 

Anyway, I hope you have some fun with Snake!
